# Code repository: Space-time logic of liver gene expression at sublobular scale
The main figures of the paper *Space-time logic of liver gene expression at sublobular scale* by Droin et al. can be recreated from this code. All the computations are done in the script "Analysis.ipynb".

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for reproducibility purposes.

## Prerequisites
We recommend you use Anaconda as a Python distribution in order to meet the required most of the Python packages used in this project. The following Python packages are used in the code:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* copy
* pandas
* warnings
* seaborn
* scipy
* signal
* multiprocessing
* operator
* xlsxwriter
* os
* statsmodels
* plotly

## Running the code
The script is a Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.7. After installing Jupyter (e.g. with Anaconda), simply run "jupyter notebook" with a terminal running in the repository and select the notebook.

## Supplementary analysis
Supplementary analysis (e.g. David analysis, smFISH) are available upon request.

## Question
In case of question about the code, please contact colas.droin [at] epfl.ch and jakob.elkholtei [at] unibas.ch. In case of question about the study, please contact felix.naef [at] epfl.ch
